        "spring_12": "Is tomorrow the anniversary of a large festival? It always smells like rotten eggs down here for a good week after.",
        "spring_25": "I was wandering the forest last night, and found a staggering amount of cut flowers and loose petals in an open field west of here. Do you know what happened there?",
        "summer_1": "It's beginning to get muggy down here, but at least it is cool. Even at night, above ground is so warm. #$b#I'm not sure I'd be able to endure mid-day heat.",
        "summer_12": "Around this time last year, a terrible stench filled the sewers, as gallon after gallon of putrid liquid poured in.#$b#I believe I spotted a flash of purple silk amongst the filth. It remains a mystery to me even now.",

        "Thu8": "Hello, @, how are you? I am not feeling so well.#$e#... It's nothing, don't trouble yourself. Would you like to buy anything today?",
        "Sat8": "Last night, I sat below the sewer grate, with it partially lifted. I listened until I heard the faint crow of a rooster - was it yours?#$b#I closed my eyes, and felt like I was in the town, amonsgt the townspeople.#$b#It was both soothing and sorrowful.",
        "Sun8": "You've opened my eyes to details of the world of humans I would never have seen alone. I appreciate your presence.",
